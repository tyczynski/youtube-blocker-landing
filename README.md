- `fix` - a bug fix
- `build` - changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci` - changes to our CI configuration files and scripts

- `test` - adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `perf` - a code change that improves performance
- `chore` - the rest of the changes that don't match, like changes in prettier or eslint config
- `release` - merge request with new release
