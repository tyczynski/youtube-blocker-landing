### Conventional commits

Commit messages are written in the specification [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Several types of commits are used in a project that as:

- `feat` - a new feature
- `fix` - a bug fix
- `build` - changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci` - changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `style` - changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `docs` - changes to the documentation
- `refactor` - a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` - adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `perf` - a code change that improves performance
- `chore` - the rest of the changes that don't match, like changes in prettier or eslint config
- `release` - merge request with new release
